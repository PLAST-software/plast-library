PLAST - c++ project
===================

This project contains:
----------------------

1. C++/11 source code ('src' directory);

2. sample Fasta files to test software ('db' directory);
   
3. cmake file to compile the project. 


Requirements
------------

1. cmake 2.6 or above;
2. gcc 4.4+ (Linux), gcc/Mingw64 (Windows) or clang (MacOSX) compiler.


Compiling PLAST
---------------

The PLAST library can be compiled in a terminal with the cmake tool. Once the source 
archive has been retrieved and unzipped, one just has to do:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

As a result, one should get a dynamic library (in 'build/lib' directory) and a binary 
(in 'build/bin' directory).

This procedure works both on Linux and MacOs.

For Windows, the Mingw64 environment has first to be deployed since the GCC compiler is 
needed for compiling PLAST (due to GCC intrinsics use). Then, one has to do:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..
    make
