PLAST - c++ project
===================

This project contains:
----------------------

1. C++/11 source code ('src' directory);

2. sample Fasta files to test software ('db' directory);
   
3. cmake file to compile the project. 


Requirements
------------

1. cmake 2.6 or above;
2. gcc 4.4+ (Linux), gcc/Mingw64 (Windows) or clang (MacOSX) compiler.


Compiling PLAST
---------------

The PLAST library can be compiled in a terminal with the cmake tool. 

As a result of source code compilation, one should get a dynamic library (in 'build/lib' 
directory) and a commend-line tool (in 'build/bin' directory). You can test resulting
binary using the 'test-plast.sh' script provided in 'scripts' directory.

Requirements: 

   * Linux: 
            kernel 2.6+ 
            gcc 4.4+ 
            cmake 2.8+

   * MacOS: 
            OS 10.7+ 
            cmake 2.8+ 
            XCode 4+ and its command-line development tools 

   * Windows: 
            Seven+
            cmake 2.8+
            Mingw64 environment (since gcc is required to compile PLAST)

Be aware that the more recent OS version you use, the more faster PLAST will be.

Once the source archive has been retrieved and unzipped, one just has to do:

Linux:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

MacOS: 
    set CC=gcc
    set CXX=g++
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Windows:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..
    make
