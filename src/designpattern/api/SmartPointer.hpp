 * as used by a client and thus one that should not be freed. The second marks
 * the reference as no longer needed by a client. When no client needs a given
 * reference, it is freed.

/** \brief Tool for managing instances life cycle
 *
 *  The goal of this class is to share easily objects between clients.
 *
 *  This class has an integer attribute that acts as a reference counter, i.e. a
 *  token counting how many clients are interested by the instance.
 *
 *  This is useful for sharing instances; if a client is interested by using an
 *  instance 'obj', she/he may call 'obj->use()' which will increase the internal
 *  token number. When the client is no more interested by using the instance 'obj',
 *  she/he may call 'obj->forget()', which will decrease the internal token.
 *
 *  When the token becomes 0, the instance is automatically destroyed.
 *
 *  Note that use() and forget() are virtual; it may happen (for singleton management
 *  for instance) that some subclass needs to refine them.
 *
 *  This pattern is often known as Smart Pointer.
 *
 *  Note that the STL provides its own smart pointer mechanism, known as auto_ptr.
 *  Here, our approach relies on subclassing instead of template use. The interest of our
 *  approach is to ease methods prototypes writing; with STL approach, one needs to uses
 *  every time auto_ptr<T> instead of only T, which can lower the readability.
 *
 *  On the other hand, our approach may be a little more dangerous than the STL approach
 *  since one has to be sure to forget an instance when needed. In our case, we use Smart
 *  Pointers mainly for attributes in class, so only have to be careful in constructors
 *  and destructors. Moreover, one can use the SP_SETATTR macro which eases this process.
 *  Note also the LOCAL macro that eases the local usage of an instance.
 *
 * This class implements also a security against concurrent access by several clients acting
 * from different threads. This is achieved by using intrinsics __sync_fetch_and_add and
 * __sync_fetch_and_sub in use and forget respectively.
 *
 * This class can't be instantiated since its default constructor is protected.
 *
 *  \see SP_SETATTR
 *  \see LOCAL

/** \brief Local usage of SmartPointer instance.
 *
 * Small utility for locally getting a reference on a smart pointer. It creates
 *  a local (ie created in the execution stack) object that takes a reference on
 *  a smart pointer and get rid of it when the execution is out of the statements
 *  block holding the local object.
 *
 *  Note that the LocalObject class is very close to the std::auto_ptr. The first
 *  one uses inheritance, the second uses templates.
 *
 *  Sample:
 *  \code
 *  void foo ()
 *  {
 *     {
 *        // we create an instance of a class that inherits from SmartPointer and link it to a LocalObject
 *        LocalObject object (new MyClass ());
 *
 *        // we can access the referenced instance
 *        object.getPtr ();
 *     }
 *
 *     // Here, the MyClass instance should have been automatically deleted.
 *  }
 *  \endcode

 *  It is dedicated to simply write clever setter methods.

 * As a convention, the attribute name must begin by an underscore. Then the provided argument here
 * is the attribute name without this leading underscore.
 *
 * A typical use of this macro is the following:
 * \li in the constructor, use the default initialization of the attribute as 0
 * \li in the constructor body, use the smart setter with a provided argument
 * \li in the destructor body, use the smart setter with null argument.
 * \li in the private (or protected) part, defines a smart setter for the attribute by using the SP_SETATTR macro

 *  \code
 *  class MyClass
 *  {
 *  public:
 *       MyClass (SomeSmartPointerClass* ptr) : _ptr(0)  { setPtr (ptr); }
 *      ~MyClass () Â { setPtr (0); }
